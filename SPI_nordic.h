Change Log

DATE      VER   WHO   WHAT
07/07/13  0.1   PC    Modified and merge all MCP2515 libraries found. Stripped
                        away most unused functions and corrected MCP2515 defs
09/12/13  0.2   PC    Added selectable CS SPI for CAN controller to use 1 IC
                        to control several mcp2515
02/05/14  0.3   PC    Added filter and mask controls
05/01/14  0.4   PC    Cleaned up functions, variables and added message
                        structures for J1939, CANopen and CAN.
05/07/14  1.0   PC    Released Library to the public through GitHub
06/18/14  1.5   NEM   Preparing a unified CAN library across three different
                        CAN controllers
06/14/15  1.6.0 NEM   Code cleanup and compatibility with Arduino 1.6.*
